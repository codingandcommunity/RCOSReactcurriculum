# Code Academy Notes - JavaScript

## Console
* Console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers
  * If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly

* Console keyword refers to an object that we can use in our code
  * Keywords are words that are built into the JS language, so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially

* .log() method
  * When we write console.log() what we put in the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console

  ```JavaScript
  console.log(5);
  ```
  * This example logs 5 to the console

## Comments

* Single line comment
```JavaScript
// Prints 5 to the Console
console.log(5);
```
* multi-line comment
```JavaScript
/*
This is
commented out
*/

console.log(/*ignored*/5);
```
