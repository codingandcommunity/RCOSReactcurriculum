# Tic Tac Toe Tutorial: My Thoughts

* https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

## Setup
* We were given 2 options:
    (1) Write code in browser
        * There was a link given to open the starter code in a new tab
        * This is quick and easy
            * Have we considered setting them up with something like this where they can easily open and edit our starter code without needing to figure out organization of files or working with different text editors or something?
    (2) Local Development Environment
        * This was the method that I chose for this tutorial, as I wanted to gain a full understanding of how React works
        * If we have them working with text editors, this will need to be very organized and we need to explicitly tell them what they have to do
        * Honestly, I struggled a bit with setting everything up and creating a project

## What is React?
* I like that it starts by explaining the concepts through a simpler example
    * Aside from the core project, we will probably have to come up with smaller examples that are still engaging to kids
* I don't think I fully understand JSX/what it is

## Inspecting the Starter Code
* I like that they provided the CSS because that's not what we're learning here
    * This sounds a lot like what we're trying to do
* I like the brief overview of the components
* I like that it sets up the structure and shows you where you will be adding code, so that there is no confusion
    * But I also feel like I would like to do all of that myself, I suppose children probably won't feel the same way though

## Passing Data Through Props
* Not gonna lie, seeing my changes show up in the browser was a really exciting moment
* I don't think that what I was doing was clear enough here though...
    * Wish I had more explanation or had to do a little more probelm solving, but maybe this can come with time as the project advances
    * Might be good to explicitly tell them what to do at first, then make them start to figure things out later on

## Making an Interactive Component
* I LOVED how it first had us add the alert on click
    * I was worried that this section was going to be too much to understand at one time but adding the intermediate step of the alert just to show how to add the interaction without any more logic was great
* The steps in this are so great.  Going from an alert on click, to entering X on click is a great progression

## Developer Tools
* I think this is a good place to break for this
* I personally don't have React DevTools downloaded but I probably will, just don't have time now

## Lifting State Up
* I feel like we just got a bit more technical here without the proper background being given
    * I didn't fully understand the parent/children parts
        * This could definitely be explained better
* This is kind of where my understanding started to fall apart

## Why Immutability is Important
* This was alright.  Definitely could have used some more detail on some of this.

## Function Components
* Again, I would like more info but overall I like this part

## Taking Turns
* This part is simple and straight-forward

## Declaring a Winner
* Also pretty straight forward

## Overall opinions
* There were definitely parts of this tutorial that were great
* The progression was appropriate
* I think there's going to be a lot of additional information needed for instruction
* Might be useful to have a vocab cheat sheet?
    * Some of the terms are just a bit hard to remember when you're just learning this stuff
        * Might be nice to have a quick reference to jog your memory
* I really like that it allows kids to create something tangible with very little background
* I don't think the kids should be supplied with exactly what to type
    * There should be some problem soling involved
